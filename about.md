I'm Ian, and I have been maintaining this blog since 2018. I wrote this blog to
sum up what I have learned recently. I think it's a good way to organize the
knowledge. And sometimes I spent several days on some quirk problems, I think
it's also a good idea to write up a post to summarize how I solved it and hope
it could help anyone who meets the same problem as I did.

me if you want to share your opinions with me.
